Configuration
The config.json file needs to contain some key information to allow the example app to communicate with the sandbox api:

clientId & clientSecret: these keys need to match the app configuration. They are sent to the sandbox's API during the authentication process.
teamDomain: this domain needs to match the domain specified in the team configuration. For a WebApp this should be the domain that the app is hosted on to allow redirection after manual authentication. For a CLI app it can just be a fake domain.
customerNumber: this is the customer whose account information you wish to request.
